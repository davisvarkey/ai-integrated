## Neural Network Regression

Although neural networks are widely known for use in deep learning and modeling complex problems such as image recognition, they are easily adapted to regression problems. Any class of statistical models can be termed a neural network if they use adaptive weights and can approximate non-linear functions of their inputs. Thus neural network regression is suited to problems where a more traditional regression model cannot fit a solution.

 The number of nodes in the input layer is determined by the number of features in the training data, in a regression model there can be only one node in the output layer. The number of nodes in the hidden layer need to set (default value is 100). By default there will be only one hidden layer. The hidden layer is fully connected to the input layer and the output layer. 

 Training settings 
 - Number of epochs
 - Learning rate
 - Number of hidden nodes (dimentions)
 - random seed
