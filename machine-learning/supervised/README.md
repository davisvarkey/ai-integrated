## Supervised Machine Learning

There are mainly two different types of supervised learning:  classification and regression. 

Classification is used when the output variable is categorical. For example, if we want to predict whether a person is male or female, then this is a classification problem.

Regression is used when the output variable is continuous. For example, if we want to predict the price of a house, then this is a regression problem.

Lifecycle of a supervised machine learning project can be depicted as follows:
