# XGBoost
XGBoost, or eXtreme Gradient Boosting is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning category, specifically the gradient boosting framework. It utilizes decision trees as base learners and employs regularization techniques to enhance model generalization. Known for its computational efficiency, feature importance analysis, and handling of missing values, XGBoost is widely used for tasks such as regression, classification, and ranking.  

XGBoost builds a predictive model by combining the predictions of multiple individual models, often decision trees, in an iterative manner.

Key features of XGBoost Algorithm include its ability to handle complex relationships in data, regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and incorporation of parallel processing for efficient computation.
